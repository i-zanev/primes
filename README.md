## Improvements

###There may be a better/faster prime algorithm
###A bit more tests - may be an end to end test
###Add some color to the output and may be make the table striped

## Happy with

###Expected a slower prime number calculation for large number of primes - quite decent in the end
###Managed to get some validation in and conditional classes showing incorrect input
